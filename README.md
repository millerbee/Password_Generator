# Password_Generator
 This generator prompts the user to verify some parameters to create a password.
 First, the password must be between 8 and 128 characters long and their entry should be numeric.
 Second, does the user want to use:
            special characters
            numbers
           upper case letters
            lower case letters

 the JS here verifies the above requirements and stores what the user would like to use.
 this app also guarantees the user will have a minimum of one each of their choice and also unique, ensuring a repeat value isn't generated.
 

 thank you to my great tutor Tyler Bolty who explains everything so well!
